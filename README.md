In this stylish action game, you will play as an unknown warrior who discovers a sacred tree. Equipped with only his deadly katana he must protect the sacred tree from evil spirits. 

My inspiration for this game came from this video by Miziziziz. As a programmer I have a hard time creating original art for my projects, but it's something that I’ve been interested in learning more about. I loved the art style in this video and decided to learn by recreating it. I came up with the idea for the game as I was working on creating the models. The game took me about 3 weeks of work from the time I started learning how to recreate the models in Blender to releasing it here. I don’t plan to add more or make it into a more full game but wanted to release it anyways. I hope you enjoy it!
